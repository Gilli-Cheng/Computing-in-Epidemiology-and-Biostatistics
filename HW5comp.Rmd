# Ex S2:  

There are three rods (rod A, rod B, and rod C) and 20 disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The 20 disks are placed in ascending order of size on rod A, while the smallest at the top, and the largest at the bottom. 

Question: Please calculate the minimum number of steps required to move the 20 disks from rod A to rod C, obeying the following rules:
1.	Only one disk can be moved in a step.
2.	No larger disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3.	__Please answer this question with a recursive function.__

```{r}
hanoi_tower <- function(n) {
        # by the pattern, the largest disc will be move with 1 step, the rest are in 2 steps
        if (n == 1) {
                cat("move disc(1)\n")
                return(1)
        } else {
                cat("move disc(", n, ")\n", sep = "")
                return(1+2*hanoi_tower(n-1)) -0.5
        }
}

hanoi_tower(20)
```



# Ex S3:  
Please use the “apply” command to calculate the medians, maximums, and minimums, of each row and each column. Missing values could be ignored.
```{r}
matrix <- matrix(
        c(3600, 5000, 12000, NA, 1000, 2000, 600, 7500, 1800, 9000,
          3600, 4500, 10000, 8500, 3000, 10000, 1000, NA, 1200, 10000,
          3800, 5500, 9000, 6000, 6600, 3000, 9600, 6500, 8200, 8000,
          5000, 6600, 13000, 4500, 5000, NA, 10600, 9500, 7600, 6000,
          6600, 8000, 17000, 3000, 7000, 1000, 12600, 8500, 6000, NA),
        5,10, byrow = TRUE)  

# by row
apply(matrix,1,median, na.rm = T)
apply(matrix,1,max, na.rm = T)
apply(matrix,1,min, na.rm = T)
# by col
apply(matrix,2,median, na.rm = T)
apply(matrix,2,max, na.rm = T)
apply(matrix,2,min, na.rm = T)
```


## Ex S8
Please find x, y, and z to satisfy 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("D:\\grad\\2023 Fall\\Computation in Biostatistics and Epidemiology\\comp_in_epi_biostat\\pic1.png")

```
 Please first build a matrix and use the “solve” command.


```{r}
x <- matrix(c(1,-3,1,1,-2,3,1,-1,1),3,3,byrow = T)
y <- c(4,6,4)
(sol <- solve(x,y))
# x %*% sol
```
